## Overview

### Description

A minimalist app that gives users one small decluttering task each day, such as deleting old photos, cleaning out a drawer, etc.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Since this app's function is to give users decluttering tasks, the mobile setting is appropriate, since most people walk around with their phones.
- **Story:** Gives an extra reminder to people (like me) who are usually unmotivated to clean.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to become neater and tidier.
- **Habit:** Users will get use to waiting for the notification, and to see what task they're assigned. 
- **Scope:** V1 Would simply give users a task everyday. V2 would allow users to add info about their daily routine, so that tasks can be recommended based on that.
